# Web Cache Deception

**Web Cache Deception** occurs when an attacker tricks the caching mechanism (CDN, proxy, or application-level cache) into **caching a sensitive, user-specific resource** (like /account, /profile, etc.) by appending **deceptive, cacheable extensions or paths** to the request.

Once cached, the next visitor (often attacker-controlled) can retrieve **private data of a previous victim**.

# Why It Happens:

Caching systems (like CDNs, reverse proxies) often:

* Cache static resources (.css, .jpg, .html)

* Do **not inspect session/auth headers** before caching

* Rely on URL patterns to determine cacheability

If the web app doesn‚Äôt validate or route unexpected paths, it may serve **authenticated content** on cacheable paths.

# Scenario:

Victim visits: https://target.com/account

Authenticated request ‚Üí shows **personal account info**

Attacker tricks victim into visiting: [https://target.com/account.css](https://target.com/account.css)

App routes /account.css to the same logic as /account, returns **authenticated data** with Content-Type: text/css

Cache (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) stores it and serves it to others.

# Impact

| Area | Risk |
| :---- | :---- |
|  Data Leakage | Attacker retrieves sensitive user info |
|  Session Info Disclosure | Full authenticated response cached and exposed |
|  Persistent Cache Poisoning | Cached content lives even after logout |
|  Exfiltration of PII | Name, email, tokens, session data |

# Example Attack Payloads

## 1\. Cacheable Extension

https://target.com/profile ‚Üí private

https://target.com/profile.css ‚Üí tricked and cached

## 2\. Append Query

/dashboard?callback=evil.com/dashboard.css

## 3\. Mixed Headers

Force Content-Type: text/css and get private data in cached response.

# Testing Steps (Manual)

**Identify sensitive endpoints:**  
/account, /settings, /orders, /dashboard, etc.

**Append a static extension:**  
/account.css, /settings.jpg, /orders.php

**Make request while logged in**, observe if content is private (HTML page, JSON with user data)

**Logout and access same URL** ‚Äî if still served, **response is cached** \= vulnerable.

**Try from Incognito or different IP/device**

# Tools for Detection

| Tool | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| üß™ Burp Suite (Manual) | Intercept & modify requests, test static extensions |
| üîß WCD Scanner (by Dolev Farhi) | Automated WCD scanner (GitHub) |
| üîç Cachebuster Extension (Burp) | Detects cacheable behavior |
| üß¨ curl/wget | Script cache checking with headers |

# Mitigation

## 1\. Add Anti-Caching Headers

Set headers on **all dynamic pages**, especially authenticated ones:

Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate  
Pragma: no-cache  
Expires: 0

## 2\. Route Strictness

Validate and **reject unexpected URL extensions** like .css, .jpg, .html for dynamic routes like /account.

/account.css ‚Üí should return 404 Not Found

## 3\. CDN Configuration

* Disable caching for URLs without extensions

* Whitelist cacheable paths only (e.g., /static/, /images/)

* Strip cookies from cache keys

* Enable private session-aware caching (if used)

## 4\. No Mixed Routing

Avoid serving **dynamic content** on paths that **look static** (e.g., /home.css, /cart.php)

## 5\. Normalize Responses

* If Content-Type is text/css, response should contain **valid CSS only**, not HTML or JSON

# Points

‚ÄúWeb Cache Deception targets **trust boundaries between cache logic and app routing**.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous because caches **don‚Äôt consider session or auth tokens**, so private data can be **served publicly**.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúFixes require a **combination of application-level and CDN-level cache hardening**.‚Äù

# Real-World WCD Exploits

| Company | Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| Facebook (Bug Bounty) | Cached user profiles via /profile.jpg |
| Twitter (2020) | Cached private tweets using misleading URL extensions |
| Uber | Account data cached via /dashboard.css |
| Several banks | Account info cached via /statements.html |
