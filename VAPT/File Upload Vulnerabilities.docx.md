# File Upload Vulnerabilities

**File upload vulnerabilities** occur when a web application allows users to **upload files without proper validation**, leading to **remote code execution**, **malware uploads**, **directory traversal**, or **DoS attacks**.

Such vulnerabilities are common in features like:

* Profile photo uploads

* Document uploads

* File-sharing services

* CMS plugins

# Why It‚Äôs Dangerous:

When untrusted users can upload arbitrary files, they may:

* Upload a **web shell** (.php, .jsp, etc.)

* Upload malware disguised as legitimate files

* Perform **path traversal** to overwrite critical files

* Upload large files to **exhaust server resources**

# Impact

| Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Remote Code Execution (RCE) | Uploading .php or .jsp file leads to full server control |
| Web Shell Access | Attacker interacts with server via uploaded shell |
| File Overwrite | Replace key config files using path manipulation |
| DoS (Denial of Service) | Upload large/binary files to crash server |
| Stored XSS / Malware | Upload script files that get served to other users |
| Data Exfiltration | Upload backdoor that reads sensitive data |

# Types of File Upload Vulnerabilities

## 1\. Unrestricted File Type Upload

* **Definition**: No restriction on file type or extension

* **Example**: Uploading shell.php via profile picture field

* **Mitigation**: Enforce strict extension/content-type allowlist (e.g., jpg, png, pdf only)

## üîπ 2\. Content-Type Bypass

* **Definition**: Attacker sets content-type to image/jpeg but uploads .php

* **Example**:

  Content-Type: image/jpeg  
  Payload: shell.php disguised as image

  **Mitigation**: Don‚Äôt trust client content-type ‚Äî verify on server using MIME-type detection

## 3\. Double Extension Bypass

* **Definition**: Uploading file like backdoor.php.jpg on systems only checking last extension

* **Mitigation**: Disallow known executable extensions in any part of filename

## üîπ 4\. Magic Bytes Bypass

* **Definition**: File extension is .jpg but file content is actually a script

* **Mitigation**: Validate file **magic bytes** (e.g., JPEG starts with FF D8 FF)

## üîπ 5\. Directory Traversal / Path Manipulation

* **Definition**: Filename like ../../../../etc/passwd used to escape intended upload directory

* **Mitigation**: Sanitize file paths, use secure upload directories with random names

## üîπ 6\. Client-Side Validation Only

* **Definition**: Only JavaScript enforces file type (e.g., .jpg) ‚Äî attacker bypasses using tools

* **Mitigation**: Enforce validations server-side, not in frontend code

# Testing Techniques

| Technique | Tool | What to Try |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Upload malicious files | Burp Suite, Postman | Try .php, .jsp, .html |
| Check execution path | Burp / Browser | Try accessing file directly via upload path |
| Rename extensions | Local testing | shell.jpg.php, abc.png;.php |
| Analyze response | Observe error or file execution behavior |  |
| Modify content-type | image/jpeg or fake headers |  |
| Use known web shells | Try uploading c99.php, b374k, etc. |  |

# Tools for Testing File Upload Vulns

| Tool | Use |
| :---- | :---- |
| Burp Suite | Intercept and manipulate upload request |
| Upload Scanner (Burp Ext) | Automated payload testing |
| OWASP ZAP | Passive/active detection |
| LinUpload | Tool to test for common bypass tricks |
| Nikto | May detect exposed upload directories |
| curl / Postman | Send manual crafted file upload requests |

# Mitigation

## 1\. File Type & Content Validation

* Allow specific extensions only (.jpg, .png, .pdf)

* Use server-side **MIME type checking** (e.g., image/jpeg)

* Validate **magic bytes**, not just file name or headers

## 2\. Rename & Isolate Uploaded Files

* Rename uploaded files to random UUIDs

* Store them **outside web root**

* Serve via a backend handler if needed

## 3\. Disallow Executables

* Block extensions: .php, .asp, .aspx, .jsp, .exe, .sh, .bat, .pl, .py

* Sanitize filenames (../, special characters, null bytes)

## 4\. Permission Control

* Uploaded files \= **non-executable**

* Use chmod 644 or equivalent

* Serve files from static, read-only folder

## 5\. Limit Upload Size & Rate

* Prevent DoS by limiting:

  * File size (e.g., 5 MB max)

  * Upload attempts

  * Disk quota per user

## 6\. Secure Upload Path

* Don‚Äôt allow user control over path

* Avoid appending user input into file paths

## 7\. Defense-in-Depth

* Use WAF (Web Application Firewall)

* Antivirus or sandbox scans for uploads

* Implement audit logging for all uploads

# Points

‚ÄúFile upload vulnerabilities are **commonly exploited for RCE**, especially in CMS, file managers, or admin panels.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways enforce **MIME sniffing \+ magic byte validation \+ strict allowlists**, and disable execution in upload folders.‚Äù

‚ÄúCheck both **storage and execution paths** to ensure that uploads can‚Äôt be triggered from browser.‚Äù

# Real-World Examples

| Case | Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| Joomla / WordPress (many CVEs) | Plugin allowed .php uploads via double extensions |
| ImageTragick (CVE-2016-3714) | Exploited image processing libraries to execute commands |
| Tesla Bug Bounty | Upload bypass in helpdesk portal allowed RCE via Python shell |

# Web Shell PoC (PHP)

\<?php system($\_GET\['cmd'\]); ?\>

Upload as shell.php, then access: [https://target.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami](https://target.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami)  
That‚Äôs a working web shell if server allows execution.
